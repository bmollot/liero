# Refactoring
Redo menu input; the duplication is disgusting.
Change build/startup to use ROMFS for resources
Introduce a new directory structure?
Upstream changes?

# Upgrades
Controller-friendly text input
Build in Joycon-oriented default profiles
To SDL2

# Triage
Settings don't seem to be saving

# Broken

Out-of-menu controls seem random?
